# Project Eueler Solutions
A repository of solutions to project Euler problems created in a number of different languages including: python, c#, ruby, javascript and VB.NET

I have only written c++ for the prist two Problems as i have very limited experience with it. if you would like to contibute a C++ (or any other language) solution for any problem please contact me at lorne123barnaby@gmail.com and you will be given full credit

I have also found that node.js runs remarkably slower than python or ruby, which are perhaps the two lanugaes o]i would most recommend for this sort of thing although the other languages have uses that they are much better suited to than mathematical calculations
